This project performs sentiment analysis on the NASA climate dataset. The dataset is cleaned, preprocessed, and then analyzed using sentiment intensity analysis. The results are then used to train a machine learning model.

Dataset

- Dataset: climate_nasa.csv
- Source: NASA

Preprocessing Steps

1. Dropped unwanted columns.
2. Handled NaN values.
3. Cleaned text data using NLTK.

Sentiment Analysis

1. Performed sentiment intensity analysis.
2. Calculated sentiment scores.

Model Training

1. Vectorized text data using TF-IDF.
2. Split dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Trained machine learning model.

Results

- Accuracy: 59%

Future Work

- Further clean the dataset.
- Try different machine learning models.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
